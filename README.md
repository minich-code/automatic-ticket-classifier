# Automatic Ticket Classifier
Customer Complaint Classification &amp; Topic Modeling

## Overview
Customer complaints are a critical indicator of service quality for financial institutions. Unresolved or mismanaged complaints can lead to customer dissatisfaction, churn, and reputational damage. Therefore, this project aims to develop an automated ticket classification model that streamlines complaint handling, ensuring timely resolution, and enhanced customer experience.

## Business Understanding
The company seeks to automate the classification of customer complaints based on the type of product or service mentioned. We will leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP), to categorize customer complaints into predefined product or service categories. This will enable efficient routing of complaints to the relevant department, reducing resolution time and improving customer satisfaction.
Additionaly, topic modeling will be incorporated to identify patterns and recurring words in the complaint data.

## Metrics of Success
1. Faster complaint resolution
2. Improved customer experience
3. Better resource allocation for the company
